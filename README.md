# Friend Finder Application

## Friend finder is an application that allows the user to take a short 10 question survey, and matches them with a friend who had the most similar results and answers of the survey. The questions are personality based, and once the user inputs their information, they are added to the network of friends and can come up as a possible match for another user. 

## This application is meant to simulate a simple dating or social networking application.

### Node.js and express server are on the back end, while Bootstrap, Materialize CSS, Javascript, and JQuery are running on the front end.
